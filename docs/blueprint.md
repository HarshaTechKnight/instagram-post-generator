## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Saffron (#FF9933) to represent the vibrancy and cultural richness of India. 
- Background color: Light beige (#F5F5DC) to provide a soft, neutral backdrop that complements the vibrant primary color without overwhelming the content.
- Accent color: Teal (#3CB371), an analogous color that is distinct enough from the saffron, while still feeling organic and harmonious. Used for buttons and interactive elements.
- Clean and modern typography that complements the visual elements. Aim for fonts which are easy to read, while also containing enough personality to match the brand. Weight and line-heights are selected to create enough contrast with the light background.
- Use simple and clear icons to represent different functionalities, such as upload, copy, and share.
- A clean and intuitive layout that puts the uploaded image and generated content front and center. The design emphasizes a smooth flow from image upload to previewing and using the generated content.
- Subtle animations and transitions to enhance user experience, such as a loading animation when generating content.
